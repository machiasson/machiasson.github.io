### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    LLab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs. In this lab we converted units from milliliters into teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups. I enjoyed this lab because unit conversions are something that is very relevant in our daily lives, and writing code to automate an everyday task is interesting to me.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3, was another favorite of mine. In this lab we computed the score of a black jack hand using one body of code. This interests me because blackjack is a game that interests me due to the amount of math involved in it the deeper you get into it. Writing code for a game that already interests me was something fun to do.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a lab I enjoyed as well. This lab was a guessing game where a player needed to guess a number between 1 and 100. I enjoyed this for a similar reason to blackjack, because it was a game that was interactive, however basic it may have been.
